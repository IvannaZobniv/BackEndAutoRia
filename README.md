<p>This is the backend of AnyCompany's platform for buying and selling cars, built using Nest.js.</p>
<p>The backend includes role-based authentication, authorization, and access control, as well as support for basic and premium user accounts.</p>
<p>In addition, the platform allows registered sellers to create car listings with a drop-down menu to select the make and model of the car.</p>
<p>Users can create lists with prices in US dollars, euros or hryvnias, prices are updated daily according to the PrivatBank exchange rate. </p>
<p>Ads are automatically checked for profanity, and premium users can access additional information about their ads, such as views and average regional prices.</p>

## Technologies Used
To get started with the backend, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Nest.js. It uses JavaScript, is built with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL. An open-source ORM is Prisma.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. We use Prisma CLI. It is recommended to call the CLI locally by prefixing it with npx:
   `npx prism'. 
4. 4.Create an initial Prisma setup using the command
   `npx prism init`.
5. Create a PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with the correct database credentials.
6. Run the `npm run start` command to start the server.
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Migration database
<p>There is a migration.sql file in the project which means that the database is already created and you need to run SQL queries from this file to create the database schema.</p>
<p>To run the migration, you can use any convenient way to run SQL queries, such as the command line, or a database application such as PostgreSQL , MySQL, Workbench or pgAdmin.</p>

- If you are working with PostgreSQL, you can use the command line and the psql command to execute SQL queries from the migration file.
- Example: `psql -U username -d database_name -f migration.sql`
where username is the database user, database_name is the database name, and migration.sql is the path to the migration file.

- If you are working with MySQL, you can use the mysql command to execute SQL queries from the migration file.
- Example: `mysql -u username -p database_name < migration.sql`
<p>After executing the SQL queries from the migration file, the database will be updated to the appropriate version and you can start interacting with it through your application.</p>

## Authentication
The server supports authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in or registers, a JWT is generated and sent to the client.

## Authorization and access control
The server includes access control for four main roles: 
- buyer
- seller
- manager
- administrator. 
<p>A user can have multiple roles. There are also roles for car dealerships.</p>
<p>The server also includes middleware to check the user's role and permissions for each request. Seller and admin can create new lists.</p>

## Premium accounts
The server supports two types of user accounts: basic and premium. Users can purchase premium accounts for a fee and access additional features such as statistics on their listings.

## Roles
- __Admin:__
- __Buyer:__
- __Carshowroom:__
- __Cardealership-admin:__
- __Cardealership-manager:__
- __Cardealership-automechanic:__
- __Cardealership-sales:__
- __Cardealership-service-manager:__
- __Manager:__
- __Seller:__
- __Seller-premium:__
